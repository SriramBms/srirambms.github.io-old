If you're building Android for a new device that's still in development, you need to add it to the file at `/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules` to access the device[^usba].

To do this, you need the `idProduct` and `idVendor` of the new Android device. 

`lsusb -v`

This command lists all the USB devices connected to the system and can be used to populate the `51-android.rules` file.
