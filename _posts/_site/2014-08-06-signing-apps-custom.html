<p>
	If you want to sign your apps for a custom Android build, first find the keys you used to sign the build. They can be usually found in,
</p>
<p><code>&lt;source directory&gt;/build/target/product/security/</code></p>

<p>
	You will see a bunch of keys in the folder. Find the platform `pem` and `pk8` files and sign the app with the following command,
</p>
<p><code>java -jar &lt;source dir&gt;/prebuilts/sdk/tools/lib/signapk.jar &lt;source dir&gt;/build/target/product/security/platform.x509.pem &lt;source dir&gt;/build/target/product/security/platform.pk8 your-app.apk your-app-signed.apk</code></p>
